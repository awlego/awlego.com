Lights

June is an endless orgy of light  
December is a seductive dance of color  
Life is harsh but beautiful. Beauty is full here. Full.  
It has to be, because life is harsh.

A poem I wrote while traveling above the article circle in Norway with my grandparents. I don't actually think life is harsh, but the stark mountains and cold water made it seem appropriate for the poem.</content><author><name>Alex Wilson</name></author><category term="Poems" /><category term="poem" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lights Are Off</title><link href="/poems/poem.lights-are-off/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lights Are Off" /><published>2021-03-18T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-03-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>/poems/poem.lights-are-off</id><content type="html" xml:base="/poems/poem.lights-are-off/">Lights Are Off

The lights are off now  
As I tell you my fears  
I’m naked and afraid  
And Sharing makes it better.  
You clutch my shoulder  
As your worries seep out  
A warmth in the darkness  
Certainty... for now.  
The lights are off now  
And there is love to make.  
But we both know  
That it has already been made.

I'm not 100% done with this piece, but maybe it will stay unfinished. I really like the line &quot;But we both know

Dark heels clicked   
striking the   
cobblestone;  
confidence.  
  
A shared spell  
Spun with warmth;  
finger tips   
in night air  
  
He shouldered   
dark threads spun   
crisp and clean,  
accents, bold.  
  
She draped white  
soft with gold  
flowing like  
rivers old  
  
He was iron  
a soft strength,  
pliable   
with furnace.  
  
She was heat   
from nothing,  
like a flame  
glorious.  
  
Tender sways  
hide still their  
frail knowledge  
shared in myth.  
  
Known only  
as bare truth.  
Believers  
‘neath night sky.

My imagination brought me a man and a woman dancing by themselves in a square late at night and it was beautiful, so I tried to write it down.</content><author><name>Alex Wilson</name></author><category term="Poems" /><category term="poem" /><summary type="html">Believers Dark heels clicked striking the cobblestone; confidence.

An aspiring cunning linguist  
The man practiced cunnilingus  
His poems penned with swirling tongue  
Until his song her lips had sung

It's silly and maybe crass, but I'm still amused.  
The first two lines came to me while on the last leg of a run. I was climbing my the hill to my house and was very out of breath trying to voice potential lines when I  passed my neighbor taking in the trash.

Late nights waiting  
By the hospital  
bed cold and bright  
Warm drip drip   
Of the morphine  
Putting up a fight  
Wandering halls alone  
with old friends  
Here in the light  
Stories shared and known  
We cried, raged, and cried  
B-ball games so tight

I'm pretty sure I wrote this after reading a chapter of Being Mortal by Atul Gawande. I'm not sure where that last line came from. It doesn't seem to fit, but I doubt I'll change it anytime soon and I like the rest of it.</content><author><name>Alex Wilson</name></author><category term="Poems" /><category term="poem" /><summary type="html">Deathbed (rough)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Music of the Ear</title><link href="/poems/poem.music-of-the-ear/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Music of the Ear" /><published>2021-02-10T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>/poems/poem.music-of-the-ear</id><content type="html" xml:base="/poems/poem.music-of-the-ear/">Music of the Ear

a kiss  
a wish  
a blink of the eye  
a beat  
a bump  
a piece of the pie  
a ring  
a king  
a crash of the sky  
a tear  
a stare  
a query of the why

Breaks of silence hold the room  
Muffling the cranking inside their heads  
Until courage rises and breath  
Solidifies history, hopes, and Being  
Old oak shelters from the  
Glory of brilliant lights above  
But holds tight the warmth they share  
From questions answered, and bodies laid bare.
