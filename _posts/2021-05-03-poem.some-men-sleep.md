Some Men Sleep  

Some men sleep  
While I am awake  
The sun hides for you  
Exhalations of your night  
But for me it shines  
In the echos of your breath  
Found in early writ  
Simple, short, sweet   
Some men sleep   
While I am awake

Written at 3:30am when I couldn't sleep one evening, thinking about sending messages to someone who will wake up before me, writen from their perspective.
