Flying

I've never run that fast
Definitely not!
Arms pulling hard
Muscles pulling against their inertia
Legs in big big circles 
as feet fly across blacktop
That RUSH!
Not of the wind,
though there is that
But of elation
I've never run that fast

It's been over a year since I started running when I decided to see try a full out sprint. I don't know how fast I was going and I don't care. There was this thrill to it that was indescribable. Just this pure rush.
