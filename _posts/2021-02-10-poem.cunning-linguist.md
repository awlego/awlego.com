Cunning Linguist

An aspiring cunning linguist  
The man practiced cunnilingus  
His poems penned with swirling tongue  
Until his song her lips had sung

It's silly and maybe crass, but I'm still amused.  
The first two lines came to me while on the last leg of a run. I was climbing my the hill to my house and was very out of breath trying to voice potential lines when I  passed my neighbor taking in the trash. That was awkward.
