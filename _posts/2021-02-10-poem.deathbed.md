Deathbed (rough)

Late nights waiting  
By the hospital  
bed cold and bright  
Warm drip drip   
Of the morphine  
Putting up a fight  
Wandering halls alone  
with old friends  
Here in the light  
Stories shared and known  
We cried, raged, and cried  
B-ball games so tight

I'm pretty sure I wrote this after reading a chapter of Being Mortal by Atul Gawande. I'm not sure where that last line came from. It doesn't seem to fit, but I doubt I'll change it anytime soon and I like the rest of it.
