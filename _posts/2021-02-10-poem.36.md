36

Breaks of silence hold the room  
Muffling the cranking inside their heads  
Until courage rises and breath  
Solidifies history, hopes, and Being  
Old oak shelters from the  
Glory of brilliant lights above  
But holds tight the warmth they share  
From questions answered, and bodies laid bare.

A poem I wrote back in 2018. I don't remember why it's titled 36. It was in a collection of birthday poems and the person I wrote it for was not turning 36.
