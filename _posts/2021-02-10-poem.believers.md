Believers  
  
Dark heels clicked   
striking the   
cobblestone;  
confidence.  
  
A shared spell  
Spun with warmth;  
finger tips   
in night air  
  
He shouldered   
dark threads spun   
crisp and clean,  
accents, bold.  
  
She draped white  
soft with gold  
flowing like  
rivers old  
  
He was iron  
a soft strength,  
pliable   
with furnace.  
  
She was heat   
from nothing,  
like a flame  
glorious.  
  
Tender sways  
hide still their  
frail knowledge  
shared in myth.  
  
Known only  
as bare truth.  
Believers  
â€˜neath night sky.

My imagination brought me a man and a woman dancing by themselves in a square late at night and it was beautiful, so I tried to write it down.
