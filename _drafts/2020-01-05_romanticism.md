Romanticism, especially a romantic view of love, has some serious problems.
Alain de Bottom has an excellent talk here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-iUHlVazKk



First I will define Romanticism for the sake of this 
Romanticism's idea of love :
1) All of us have a soul mate
2) You will know when you meet your soul mate by chance... you'll get that *Special Feeling*
2) Into the idea of the 'crush'
3) Happily ever after -- love is a magical thing that solves all of your problems.
4) No one has to work, so a lot of time can be devoted to love
5) Nature is incredibly important; long walks, beachs, waterfalls, etc all very romantic.
6) Consecrated sex as the summit of love. The highest form of love for another person.
    - has the side effect of turning adultery into a catastrophy.
7) Pure and good natured human kind at the core (children the main image)
8) Low or no focus on the practical sides of life. 
9) Understanding without words - Romantics believe that your lover can intuit your thoughts through the closed bathroom door

We're all deeply crazy. No one gets through childhood entirely in tact. We're all distored in some way.

That *Special Feeling*:

Romantic

Romanticism: essentia

## Conspiracy of Self-Knowledge
It may be suprising to find out that it's difficult to find self-knowledge, but often it is the case. Part of the problem is something of a conspiracy where no one in your life is very incentivized to tell you about the things that are wrong with you.
 *Parents won't tell you, they are often blinded by love and may not want to confront you. 
 *Friends won't tell you, they just want a good time and may not want to go deeper, exposing anything potentially nasty.
 *Your exes definitely know what's wrong, but can't be bothered either. Often it's not worth their time and they simply leave, shrugging off with other excuses about why they want to break up ("Oh I need to travel more... take time to find myself..."). 

## How are you crazy?
Asking 'How are you crazy?' on an early dinner date would be a good idea. Think about how much time we could save if we found out early what is wrong with each other. With a calm backdrop, this provides a way to talk about the ways that we are flawed. Being able to have that discussion also is a strong signal of emotional health. The self-knowledge required to know how you are broken and having the maturity to have an honest conversation about or flaws shows a lot of emotional and relational health. I recommend asking this question, or a similar one, early on in the dating scene. It's quite reasonable to ask this on a second or third date. It's very important to have this discussion at a time when you haven't been hurt by their craziness

## Searching for someone familiar
Alain de Botton mentions that we aren't really looking for someone who will make us happy. Instead we are looking for someone familiar. Someone who will make us suffer in familiar ways (going back to the physcotherapy of how we learned love should be as a child). Is this something that we should seek? Should we seek someone familiar? Or is it better to know that we naturally might seek someone who makes us unhappy in familiar ways and to purposefully avoid people that express that kind of love.

## Preperation for the practical sides of life
Romantic ideas of love have almost no mentions of the practical things in life. Laundry, cooking, cleaning, maintence, organizing and others are all been forgotten. Unfortunately, these are all a very real part of life, and a romantic view of love doesn't adequately prepare us for realizing that these things are all involved in love. Learning to love in and through the daily required parts of life is a skill that should be emphasized more than romantism does.

## Mind Meld


## On Teaching
View your significant other has a small child 2-3 year old.
Best way to teach is to be calm. Don't mind if your lesson doesn't get learned.
Never make them feel humiliated. No one ever teachs successfully through humiliation.

Greek love: love is the admiration for the perfect sides of another human being. You should be generous and forgiving towards the other sides, but you don't love them. Instead you only love that which is virtuous and worthwile in another person's personality, acomplishments, manners, methods, and actions.

Lecture's in love. Lookinging for someone to give mutual lectures to.
Plato's yes I'm giving you a lecture! And tomorrow I hope you give me one!
